# Pathfinding Visualizer

### At present, only the Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search algorithms have been implemented in the system.

The Pathfinding Visualizer allows you to interactively explore how these algorithms find the shortest path between two points in a grid.You can create your own grid, place obstacles, and select the start and end points, then watch as the algorithm works its way through the grid in real-time. The color-coded path and step-by-step process make it easy to see the algorithms in action and understand how they reach the solution.
